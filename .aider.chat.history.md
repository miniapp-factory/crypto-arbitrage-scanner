I need to edit the app metadata file to update the title and description, and I’ll create a new logo‑generation file.  
Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can propose the exact changes.

A stylized logo featuring two interlocking arrows forming a circle around a stylized coin icon, representing real-time arbitrage across exchanges. The design uses a sleek blue and green color palette with a subtle gradient, conveying speed, precision, and financial technology. The background is a light gray gradient to make the logo stand out on various backgrounds.
